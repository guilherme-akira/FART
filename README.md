# FART - Feebly Acceptable Ray Tracer
A poor implementation of a Ray Tracer.

This is an implementation of the project proposed by the 42 School in this [document](doc/en.subject.pdf), without respecting all the constraints imposed by the institution.
To handle all the graphic stuff, I'm using SDL2 for instance.
The structure of the code was made by myself, but the ray tracing-specific algorithm was taken from these resources:
